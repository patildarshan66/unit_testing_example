# unit_testing_example

## Description:
This project serves as an example of how to implement unit testing in a Flutter application. Unit testing is an essential practice in software development that ensures the reliability and correctness of individual units of code. In this project, we demonstrate how to write unit tests for various functionalities using the Flutter testing framework.
 
## Key Features:

Unit Testing Fundamentals: Explore the basics of unit testing in Flutter, including writing tests for functions, methods, and classes.

## Project Structure:

* lib/: Contains the source code of the Flutter application, including functions, widgets, and classes to be tested.
* test/: Contains unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests written using the Flutter testing framework.
* README.md: Provides instructions for setting up the project, running tests, and understanding the testing methodology used.

## How to Use:

* Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
* Navigate to the project directory.
* Install dependencies using flutter pub get.
* Run tests using flutter test.
* Explore the test files in the test/ directory to understand how different types of tests are implemented.
* Modify and expand the tests to fit your project requirements.
